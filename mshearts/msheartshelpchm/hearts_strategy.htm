<UL>
	<LI>Avoid taking a <A ID="wPopup" HREF="HELP=mshearts.hlp TOPIC=HEARTS_TRICK">trick</A> containing hearts or the queen of spades. The only time you will want to take such tricks is when you are trying to Shoot the Moon or trying to prevent someone else from successfully Shooting the Moon.  <P>To <I>Shoot the Moon</I> is to collect all the hearts and the queen of spades. When that happens, you score zero points and each other player scores 26 points. Your chances of successfully Shooting the Moon are best if your hand contains a large number of high-value hearts and spades.</P>
	</LI>
	<LI>On hands that begin by passing cards to an opponent, pass cards with high values, such as aces or face cards.
	</LI>
	<LI>Play your highest cards early in the game, while your opponents are likely to have some cards in each suit and will have to play those cards instead of hearts. Tricks that do not contain any hearts or the queen of spades do not add to your score.
	</LI>
	<LI>Keep track of which cards have been played, particularly whether the queen of spades has been played and whether hearts have been broken (that is, whether a heart has been discarded on an earlier trick).
